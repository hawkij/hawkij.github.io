## About me

I’m in my final year of a PhD in the Engineering Department at the University of Cambridge. During my PhD I have developed a “calculator" (a computational model based on physical flows) to quantify the aggregated energy demands of Net-Zero proposals. The model estimates the overall demands of carbon storage, non-emitting electricity and biomass which I then compare against feasible availability of those resources. Find out more by playing with our interactive version of [ZERCalc](https://zercalc.web.app/)!

Previously I worked as a chartered mechanical engineer at Rolls-Royce (for seven years spread across aviation, marine and nuclear), and for Engineers-Without-Borders, EWB (one year in Malaysian Borneo). I have a MEng and BA in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cambridge.
