# Hello!

Welcome to my webpage! Read on to find out more...

## About me

I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Univerisity of Sheffield, looking into resource efficiency of plastics and chemicals. Two areas of my current work include quantification of petrochemical material flows (and emissions impacts) throughout Europe and the environmental impacts of plastic waste management.

During my PhD (in the University of Cambridge, Engineering Dept.) I developed a “calculator" (a computational model based on physical flows) to quantify the aggregated energy demands of Net-Zero proposals. The model estimates the overall demands of carbon storage, non-emitting electricity and biomass which I then compare against feasible availability of those resources. Find out more by playing with our interactive version of [ZERCalc](https://zercalc.web.app/)!

Previously I worked as a chartered mechanical engineer at Rolls-Royce (for seven years spread across aviation, marine and nuclear), and for Engineers-Without-Borders, EWB (one year in Malaysian Borneo). I have a MEng and BA in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cambridge.

## My research interests

- Whole system modelling
- Transition modelling and infrastructure deployment rates, particularly geological carbon capture and storage
- Systematic understanding of the effect of negative emissions, biogenic carbon, and land-use change (implications of accounting mechanisms and equivalence between permanent/impermanent sequestration)
- Political, technical, and economic challenges of achieving a low climate-impact aviation sector
- Concepts of risk and risk management as frameworks to consider both climate change, and climate change mitigation
- Real-world effects and impacts of mitigation interventions
