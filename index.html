<h1>Jennifer Hawkin</h1>
<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>I’m in my final year of a PhD in the Engineering Department at the University of Cambridge. During my PhD I have developed a “calculator" (a computational model based on physical flows) to quantify the aggregated energy demands of Net-Zero proposals. The model estimates the overall demands of carbon storage, non-emitting electricity and biomass which I then compare against feasible availability of those resources.</p>

<p>Previously I worked as a chartered mechanical engineer at Rolls-Royce (for seven years spread across aviation, marine and nuclear), and for Engineers-Without-Borders, EWB (one year in Malaysian Borneo). I have a Master of Engineering (MEng) and BA in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cambridge, and experience in both large and small engineering organisations. I'm someone with a dedicated interest and enthusiasm for learning and building knowledge across sectors, disciplines and environments.</p>

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Whole system modelling</li>
  <li>Transition modelling and infrastructure deployment rates, particularly geological carbon capture and storage</li>
  <li>Systematic understanding of the effect of negative emissions, biogenic carbon, and land-use change (implications of accounting mechanisms and equivalence between permanent/impermanent sequestration)</li>
  <li>Political, technical, and economic challenges of achieving a low climate-impact aviation sector</li>
  <li>Concepts of risk and risk management as frameworks to consider both climate change, and climate change mitigation</li>
  <li>Real-world effects and impacts of mitigation interventions</li>
